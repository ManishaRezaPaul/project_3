For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:
Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
1. A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
2. A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
3. A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
4. Project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
5. Project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
6. Project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
7. Final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
